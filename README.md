# AI Governance Seeds

## Overview
This repository is a collection of **seed frameworks** for advancing human–AI governance.  
Each framework originates from solo exploratory work supported by multi-AI collaboration.  
They are not final models, but **conceptual seeds**: structured ideas intended for testing, critique, and development.

## Included Frameworks

### 1. ACP – AI Co-Governance Protocol
**Core Idea:**  
Triangulate decisions through three AI “lenses” (Analytical, Pragmatic, Systemic) to improve clarity, reduce bias, and increase systemic resilience.  

**Applications:**  
- Policy and crisis response  
- Organizational strategy  
- Human–AI co-decision-making

### 2. CSR – Containment → Sovereignty
**Core Idea:**  
Collapse is not failure but **signal**. Systems can transmute collapse into resilience through three phases: Containment → Signal Extraction → Sovereignty.  

**Applications:**  
- Crisis management  
- Organizational learning  
- AI safety protocols

### 3. CEP – Containment Equilibrium Protocol
**Core Idea:**  
A new equilibrium type where stability emerges from suppressing **high-signal moves** that could trigger collapse. Unlike Nash (payoff) or Schelling (coordination), CEP optimizes for **system survival**.  

**Applications:**  
- Fragile geopolitical systems  
- Corporate governance under stress  
- AI alignment and risk suppression

## Positioning
These repos should be understood as:
- **Seeds** – starting points, not finished products  
- **Open frameworks** – designed for critique, refinement, and empirical testing  
- **Bridges** – translating lived experience and AI collaboration into governance language  

---

## Next Steps
1. Literature integration across political science, crisis management, and AI governance.  
2. Development of operational metrics for containment and equilibrium.  
3. Empirical case studies to validate frameworks.  
4. Collaborative testing with researchers and governance practitioners.

## Disclaimer
These frameworks are **conceptual explorations**. They do not claim empirical validation. Their purpose is to provide structured starting points for discussion and further research.
